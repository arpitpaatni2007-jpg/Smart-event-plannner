⚙️ How It Works

User fills the event form and clicks Add Event

JavaScript validates inputs

Event is added to an in-memory array

Events are rendered dynamically on the UI

User can delete events or clear all events

Event counter updates automatically on every change

All updates happen using JavaScript DOM methods like:

document.getElementById

createElement

innerHTML

addEventListener
